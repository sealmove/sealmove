## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a software engineer who studied in University of Peloponnese (Tripoli, Greece) and AGH University of Science and Technology (Warsaw, Poland).

My research field is **compilers**. I am a member of the [Kaitai Struct](https://kaitai.io/) project since 2019 where I implemented a new compiler backend (code generation) to support the [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/) programming language as a target. I also developed a native solution as a Nim DSL, [binarylang](https://github.com/sealmove/binarylang).

Having a strong JVM ecosystem background thanks to my contribution to Kaitai Struct, which is written in Scala, and the heavily Java-focused university curriculum, I recently started experimenting with **Android app development with Kotlin**, which I love.
