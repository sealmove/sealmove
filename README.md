## Software Engineer
Hi there. I am a software developer from Greece. My main area of interest and professional orientation is **Data Engineering**. I have a strong background in Scala and the JVM ecosystem thanks to my contribution to [Kaitai Struct](https://kaitai.io/) and the heavily Java-focused curriculum of the university from which I graduated. Academically I specialize in **Compiler Engineering** where I pioneered in the field of _binary parser generators_. Finally, **Appsec** is of great interest to me. I frequently raise my security awareness and technical skills by partitipating in CTF competitions with buddies.
