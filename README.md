## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a software engineer from Greece.
Recently I started experimenting with **Android app development with Kotlin** after establishing a strong background around JVM ecosystem thanks to my contribution to [Kaitai Struct](https://kaitai.io/) (Scala) and the heavily Java-focused curriculum of the university from which I graduated.
Favorite topics include **Compilers** and **Appsec**. My involvement in those include pioneering in the field of binary parser generators and occasionally competing in CTFs.
